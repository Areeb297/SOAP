 Hello, I'm Dr. Kreme from the IA. Before we begin, can I have your name, age and what you are from? I'm Adam Salah, 34 years old and I live in Jeddah. Nice to meet you, Adam. Can you tell me what brought you here today? Dr. I had just tightness and shortness of breath since this morning. Started suddenly when I was working to work. All of us have been going about three hours now. Still I'm going with a bit less intense. Have you had this before? No. Have I experienced this before? Very bad. Radiating 3 hours more job. No. But I do feel pressure and much overshift. Any splitting or business? I had light-sweetening and some nocy initially. Do you have any medical history? Yes, I have high blood pressure and I'm on medication for it. What medication are you taking? I'm a little thin. And as I was before, ten years ago, family history of heart disease. Yes, my father had a heart attack at 50. Okay, Adam, we will check your vital signs doing ECG and some blood tests including cardiac resumes. We will see you in the next six weeks.
