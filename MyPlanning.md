## New Task: UI Structure Changes for SOAP Note Sections

### Goal
Implement UI changes to improve SOAP note section structure and styling.

### Changes Required
1. **Add section names as comments in each div**
   - Add `<!-- SUBJECTIVE Section -->` before subjective section div
   - Add `<!-- OBJECTIVE Section -->` before objective section div  
   - Add `<!-- ASSESSMENT Section -->` before assessment section div
   - Add `<!-- PLAN Section -->` before plan section div

2. **Add CSS classes to section divs**
   - Add `subjective` class to subjective section div
   - Add `objective` class to objective section div
   - Add `assessment` class to assessment section div
   - Add `plan` class to plan section div

3. **Add wrapper div for SOAP data**
   - Add `<div class="soap_data">` before the first SOAP section
   - Close this div before the Agreement Section

### Implementation Steps
- [x] Update SOAPSection component to include section-specific CSS classes
- [x] Add HTML comments for each section
- [x] Wrap all SOAP sections in a `soap_data` div
- [x] Test the changes to ensure proper styling and structure
- [x] Mark task complete after implementation

### Task Status: âœ… COMPLETED
The UI structure changes have been successfully implemented:
- Added section-specific CSS classes (`subjective`, `objective`, `assessment`, `plan`) to each SOAP section div
- Added HTML comments (`<!-- SUBJECTIVE Section -->`, etc.) before each section
- Wrapped all SOAP sections in a `soap_data` div container
- The changes maintain existing functionality while improving code structure and styling capabilities

## New Task: Add Username/Password Authentication After User Agreement

### Goal
Implement an additional security layer by requiring username and password input after the user agreement checkbox before allowing PDF/TXT downloads.

### Changes Required
1. **Add state management for authentication**
   - Add state for username and password input
   - Add state to track if authentication is completed
   - Add state to show/hide authentication form

2. **Create authentication form component**
   - Username input field
   - Password input field (with proper type="password")
   - Confirm/Save button
   - Cancel button to go back

3. **Update download button logic**
   - Change condition from `userAgreement` to `userAgreement && isAuthenticated`
   - Show authentication form when checkbox is checked
   - Hide authentication form when authentication is completed

4. **Improve user experience**
   - Clear form when user unchecks agreement
   - Add proper validation for username/password fields
   - Add loading state during authentication process

### Implementation Steps
- [x] Add new state variables for authentication
- [x] Create authentication form component
- [x] Update user agreement checkbox logic
- [x] Update download button conditions
- [x] Add form validation and error handling
- [x] Test the complete authentication flow
- [x] Mark task complete after implementation

### Task Status: âœ… COMPLETED
The authentication feature has been successfully implemented:
- Added state management for username, password, authentication status, and form visibility
- Created a clean authentication form with proper validation
- Updated user agreement checkbox to show authentication form when checked
- Modified download buttons to require both agreement and authentication
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

# Task: Integrate Arabic Font for PDF Export (jsPDF)

## Goal
Ensure that Arabic text in generated PDFs is displayed correctly for all users, with no extra downloads or setup required by end users.

## Steps

### 1. Convert the TTF Font to jsPDF Format
- Go to the [jsPDF font converter tool](https://simonbengtsson.github.io/jsPDF-AutoTable/tools/font-converter.html).
- Upload your `NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.ttf` file (found in `soap-recorder-frontend/public/fonts/`).
- Set the font name to `NotoNaskhArabic` (or keep the default if you prefer).
- Click "Download js-file" to get the converted font file (e.g., `NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js`).

### 2. Add the Converted Font File to Your Project
- Place the downloaded `NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js` file in your project, e.g., in `soap-recorder-frontend/public/fonts/` or `soap-recorder-frontend/src/fonts/`.

### 3. Import the Font in Your Code
- In your `SOAPRecorder.js` (or wherever you generate the PDF), add:
  ```js
  import '../public/fonts/NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js';
  // or
  // import '../src/fonts/NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js';
  ```
  (Adjust the path as needed based on where you placed the file.)

### 4. Update PDF Generation Logic
- Remove any dynamic font loading logic (e.g., `addFileToVFS`, `addFont`, and base64 font loading for NotoNaskhArabic).
- Before rendering Arabic text, set the font:
  ```js
  doc.setFont('NotoNaskhArabic', 'normal');
  ```
- Keep your logic for detecting Arabic and switching fonts as needed.

### 5. Test PDF Export
- Generate a SOAP note in Arabic and download as PDF.
- Open the PDF and verify that Arabic text displays correctly.
- Test on a different device/browser to confirm it works for all users.
