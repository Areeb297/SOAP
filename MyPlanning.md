## New Task: Fix React Runtime Error - Objects as React Children

### Goal
Fix the React runtime error that occurs when generating SOAP notes, where JavaScript objects are being passed as children to React components.

### Issue Identified
- **React Error**: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {dosage, duration, frequency, name, route})"
- **Root Cause**: Medication objects (with dosage, duration, frequency, name, route) were being passed directly to SpellCheckedSOAPField
- **Trigger**: Error occurs when clicking "Generate SOAP Note"
- **Impact**: Application crashes when trying to render medication data

### Solution: Conditional Rendering
- **String/Number Values**: Use SpellCheckedSOAPField for spell checking
- **Objects/Arrays**: Use regular renderValue function without spell checking
- **Type Checking**: Add proper type validation before passing to spell checker
- **Safe Conversion**: Ensure all values are properly converted to strings

### Implementation Steps
- [x] Add type checking in SOAPRecorder render logic
- [x] Use SpellCheckedSOAPField only for string/number values
- [x] Use regular renderValue for objects and arrays

# Task: Integrate Arabic Font for PDF Export (jsPDF)

## Goal
Ensure that Arabic text in generated PDFs is displayed correctly for all users, with no extra downloads or setup required by end users.

## Steps

### 1. Convert the TTF Font to jsPDF Format
- Go to the [jsPDF font converter tool](https://simonbengtsson.github.io/jsPDF-AutoTable/tools/font-converter.html).
- Upload your `NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.ttf` file (found in `soap-recorder-frontend/public/fonts/`).
- Set the font name to `NotoNaskhArabic` (or keep the default if you prefer).
- Click "Download js-file" to get the converted font file (e.g., `NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js`).

### 2. Add the Converted Font File to Your Project
- Place the downloaded `NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js` file in your project, e.g., in `soap-recorder-frontend/public/fonts/` or `soap-recorder-frontend/src/fonts/`.

### 3. Import the Font in Your Code
- In your `SOAPRecorder.js` (or wherever you generate the PDF), add:
  ```js
  import '../public/fonts/NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js';
  // or
  // import '../src/fonts/NotoNaskhArabic-Regular.js';
  ```
  (Adjust the path as needed based on where you placed the file.)

### 4. Update PDF Generation Logic
- Remove any dynamic font loading logic (e.g., `addFileToVFS`, `addFont`, and base64 font loading for NotoNaskhArabic).
- Before rendering Arabic text, set the font:
  ```js
  doc.setFont('NotoNaskhArabic', 'normal');
  ```
- Keep your logic for detecting Arabic and switching fonts as needed.

### 5. Test PDF Export
- Generate a SOAP note in Arabic and download as PDF.
- Open the PDF and verify that Arabic text displays correctly.
- Test on a different device/browser to confirm it works for all users.
