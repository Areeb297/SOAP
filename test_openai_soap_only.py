Patient: Sarah Johnson, 28 years old, presents with chest pain that started 3 hours ago. The pain is sharp, located in the center of her chest, and worsens with deep breathing. She went hiking last weekend and has been under stress lately, which has caused cold sores to appear. She has no known allergies and is not currently taking any medications.

Dr. Smith examined the patient and found her vital signs to be stable. Heart rate is 85 bpm, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg. Physical examination reveals tenderness over the chest wall.

Assessment: The patient likely has costochondritis, possibly related to physical activity from hiking.

Plan: Prescribed ceftriaxone 1g IV daily, pentoxifylline 400mg twice daily, gabapentin enacarbil 600mg at bedtime, doxycycline 100mg twice daily, and valacyclovir 500mg twice daily for cold sores. Patient education provided about avoiding strenuous activities. Follow-up in one week.

IMPORTANT: Do not omit any information mentioned in the conversation. If something is mentioned, it must be included in the appropriate section. Use exact quotes and details from the conversation rather than generic phrases.

REMINDER FOR PATIENT NAME: 
- Extract the actual patient name, not the doctor's name
- If you see "Patient: [Name]" extract only the name part
- Do NOT prefix patient names with "Dr." unless the patient themselves is explicitly identified as a doctor
- If a name appears after "Patient:" or "The patient", that is the patient's name
- If the transcript is very short (e.g., just a greeting), and no names are mentioned:
  - For provider_name: Keep as "Dr. Unknown" or "Dr. Not mentioned"
  - For patient_name: Keep as "Unknown" (do not use greetings like "Hello" as names)
  - For patient_age: Keep as "Unknown" if not mentioned
- Common greetings like "Hello", "Hi", "Good morning" are NOT names

EXAMPLES:
- If transcript is "Hello Doctor", patient_name should be "Unknown", NOT "Hello" or "Doctor"
- If transcript is "Dr. Smith: Hello Sarah, how are you?", then provider_name is "Dr. Smith" and patient_name is "Sarah"
- If transcript is "Patient: John Doe, 45 years old", then patient_name is "John Doe" and patient_age is "45"
